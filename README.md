# AI Travel Consultant

### Overview

The AI Travel Consultant is a conversational AI system that provides travel recommendations based on user queries. It leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to enhance responses by retrieving relevant information from a vector database before generating an answer. The chatbot maintains memory for a more engaging and context-aware conversation.

The system follows a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach:
- Web Scraping: Extracts real-time travel data such as weather, popular destinations, and current travel restrictions.
- Retrieve Relevant Information: Uses a ChromaDB vector store to retrieve contextual information.
- Generate Responses: Passes the retrieved context and query to MistralAI for natural language generation.

### Tools & Technologies:

- LangChain ‚Üí Framework for building LLM applications
-  Scrapy: For extracting travel-related data from websites.
- MistralAI ‚Üí Language model for response generation
- ChromaDB ‚Üí Vector database for document retrieval


### Key Design Decisions

1Ô∏è. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

- Instead of relying solely on the LLM‚Äôs internal knowledge, the system retrieves context from a vector database, improving accuracy and relevance.

2. Modular Structure

- rag_pipeline.py: Contains functions for initializing the RAG pipeline and generating answers.
- vector_store.py: Handles vector database loading.
- main.py: Provides the CLI interface for user interaction.
    
3. Incorporation of Web Scraping:
   
- Ensures real-time and updated travel information instead of relying solely on static datasets.
