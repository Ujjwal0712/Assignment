    "article": " We know travel often increases your carbon footprint. But it also connects – and brings opportunities to – people around the world. It can change lives and support communities. So we at Culture Trip have started a journey to help you travel responsibly. Our actions aren’t perfect (and probably never will be as there is so much to do). But they come from good intentions and our passionate team is dedicated to building on what we do today. We’re here to help you make more sustainable choices. \n We have joined \n – an initiative supported by more than 300 travel organisations, companies and professionals working together to take purposeful action for a better future for tourism. As part of Tourism Declares a Climate Emergency we – like all signatories – have committed to: \n developing a \n by August 2022 (you can read about our first steps on this page)\n accepting current IPCC advice stating the need to cut global carbon emissions to 55 percent below 2017 levels by 2030, to keep the planet within 1.5 degrees of warming\n working together with peers, suppliers and partners to share best practice and grow the community\n sharing our commitment and updating on our progress\n advocating for change across the industry \n The desire to explore the world is as strong as ever, but so is the need to travel in a better way \n Our trips are all put together with conscious travellers in mind – and with a focus that goes beyond mass-market offerings. This approach means you can travel more responsibly with us and enjoy a more authentic experience – really getting under the skin of a destination. All our trips are built on three key pillars: \n \n \n We put local people at the centre of our trips, which provides income and helps spread the economic benefits of tourism around the community. It also means you connect with local cultures and people, hear their stories and discover their traditions. \nSee \n.\n Here’s how we do this: \n for each trip, a Local Insider, who knows the destination inside out, leads our small groups; we also use local drivers. Working with local people means we contribute towards employment and economic growth in the destinations we visit\n wherever possible, we use locally owned and run places to stay\n we carefully research and source local activities that are authentic. These include going to a market to buy food, before a cooking class at a host’s home; visiting organisations that run initiatives to empower local women; and learning about traditional wine-making methods \n Authentic, local activities contribute to economic growth within the host community \n \n \n We can all make changes to the way we travel; however small, they make a difference. And with the increasing impact of climate change, this has never been more important. \n That’s why we’ve partnered with the eco-whizzes at Path Net Zero, who will use their industry-leading tech to calculate the emissions of each of our Epic Trips, Mini Trips and Sailing Trips. With the totals totted, we’ll then offset those emissions by purchasing carbon credits. \n Path Net Zero will then put those credits towards Gold Standard-certified projects and programmes – each of which helps fast track our journey towards the Net Zero ambition of the Paris Climate Agreement and benefits wider Sustainable Development Goals. \n Those invaluable projects include reforestation, generating new renewable energies, and sponsoring eco-initiatives and wildlife eco-projects – all critical to the sustainability of the travel industry. \n It’s our little way of exploring the best of the planet, while still being good to it. \n Our work doesn’t stop there though. Other key elements of our trips are: \n aiming to avoid areas blighted by overtourism\n prioritising more ethical methods of transport, like train travel, whenever possible\n only having small groups, which means a smaller impact – our groups average 10 travellers \n \n \n We properly screen the experiences on our trips so we don’t include any unethical practices or activities that aren’t in the best interest of the animals or wildlife. We actively encourage travellers to be mindful of animal welfare issues at a local level and endeavour to provide useful tips on how to travel more responsibly, what to look out for and any do’s and don’ts while in the destination. \n Here’s how: \n we accept that the welfare of wild animals is compromised in captivity – it is only acceptable when it is in the animal’s best interests, such as orphaned young unable to survive in the wild, and when the highest possible standards of care are given to that animal\n we work with our local partners to ensure we don’t include any unethical activities on our trips, such as elephant riding or visiting sanctuaries where animals are handled or drugged for tourist entertainment\n we only ever include rides in our trips with animals that are considered domestic or working animals — such as camels, horses and donkeys; however, we only include them once the wellbeing of the animals has been clearly established \n We believe wild animals should stay that way wherever possible \n \n \n Together with our partner Tree-Nation, we are helping to reforest the world. We do this by offsetting the CO2 emissions generated by our employees, including work space, electricity, water, paper, short-distance team travel and occasional long-distance travel. The emissions of an office-based employee average 3 tonnes to 3.6 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year (according to calculations by French company Sinteo/ARSEG, then adapted to the European average). So, every month at Culture Trip, together with Tree-Nation, we plant enough trees to offset our team’s CO2 emissions. \n We’ve teamed up with Tree-Nation to create the Culture Trip Forest \n \n \n Every month, millions of people come to Culture Trip for travel inspiration. We are using our global reach to nudge them towards more responsible travel, and we can do this by providing practical tips and recommendations. Read about our \n, the \n, the \n, the \n, the \n, or \n. \n \n \n We have implemented Feel Good Flex, a flexible work programme that allows all employees to work remotely and gives them more freedom as to when and where they work. This makes it easier for employees to balance their work and personal life and helps us to cut carbon emissions by reducing the amount we commute. \n \n \n At Culture Trip, every member of staff has an allowance of two volunteering days per year during work hours to help their community and wider areas. This aims to better connect us all to the society around us, by helping our staff support organisations and charities with their time and skills. \nThe Most Beautiful Places in the West Country, UK\nUnited Kingdom's Coolest Neighbourhoods\nThe 10 Most Beautiful Opera Houses Around The World\nThe Most Scenic Train Journeys You Can Experience in Europe\nThe UK’s Top Museums and Art Galleries Outside of London\nThe Best Places To See William Blake's Art\nThe Coolest Neighbourhoods To Visit in Newcastle upon Tyne\n25 Places in Mediterranean Europe You Must See at Least Once in Your Lifetime\n24 Belfast Murals You Need to See\nThe 15 Most Beautiful Lakeside Towns and Villages in Europe\n18 Incredible Places in Europe You Never Knew Existed\nThe 10 Best European Museums for Contemporary Art\nWinter Sale \nSave up to $1,150 on our trips!

The Haveli is an old 18th-century mansion with over 100 rooms, each displaying the most incredible pieces of Udaipur’s culture and heritage, from traditional costumes to glass work and handicrafts. To enjoy the true essence of Udaipur, stick around for the folk dance performances in the evenings, featuring women dancing with pots on their heads and playing with fire and bells, while their colorful long skirts swing in bright circles. As well as dancing, puppet shows and sword-fighting are some of the other enthralling performances enacted by the artisans.\nBuilding, Historical Landmark, Architectural Landmark\nThe architectural beauty of Udaipur is such a treat to the eyes, with pillars, softly curving arches and pastel colors everyone your turn, that one of the best things to do is to take a simple walk around the streets of the city early in the morning. The cobbled pathways, eccentric graffiti on the walls, local people walking around in their traditional costumes all create a welcoming, authentic atmosphere fill of beauty, and there’s plenty of time to stop off at a warm little coffee house for breakfast or to feed the pigeons.\nBuilding, Architectural Landmark\nFeatured the James Bond movie Octopussy (1983), City Palace is the largest of its kind in Rajasthan. The palace has cleverly designed interiors designed to protect the king and his people from the enemy, and walking around the palace with a guide is indispensable for learning about the war techniques used, the traditional methods of defense, and daily life at the palace. Built on a hill top over 400 years ago, City Palace gives a breathtaking panoramic view of Rajasthan and many of Udaipur’s other jewels, including Jagdish Temple, Neemach Mata Temple and Jagmandir.\nHindu Temple\nBuilding\nLake Garden Palace, known as the Jag Mandir, took three generations of Maharajas to be completed. The defining feature of the palace is its unique location on Lake Pichola, with the only mode of access to the palace being via boat. Jag Mandir includes numerous different aspects, including Gul Mahal, the palace’s original structure now incorporating into the rest of the building, the charming elephant façades, and the beautiful Garden Courtyard.\nSee \n.\nBuilding\nRajasthan is not only about camel rides, colorful dances and royal architecture, but is also a leader in the field of science. The Solar Observatory in the Fateh Sagar Lake is a marvelous structure that allows visitors to stare directly at the sun without any damage or discomfort. Through their solar telescope, it is possible to marvel at the red ball of fire. Built by Dr. Arvind Bhatnagar, the Solar Observatory is the best solar observatory in Asia, and is a wonderful alternative to many of the traditional sights and activities.\nRestaurant, Vegetarian\nBotanical Garden\nSaheliyon Ki Bari is a very popular garden and major tourist attraction in Udaipur. What sets it apart from other parks and gardens in the area is the extraordinary architecture and planning that has gone into creating such a beautiful place. Originally designed by Rana Sangram Singh for his wife, Saheliyon Ki Bari has a lotus pool with elephants standing on corners spurting water from their trunks. There is also a central pool which showers water in a rain-like effect – a perfect respite from the scorching Rajasthani heat.\nBuilding\nSajjan Garh, also known as the Monsoon Palace, was built in the 19th century, and was intended as a place to watch the approaching monsoon clouds. Located high on a hilltop overlooking the city, visitors can enjoy the panoramic views of Udaipur from the palace windows. The palace also overlooks the Sajjan Singh Sanctuary, a reserve for numerous reptiles, tigers, deer, panthers and jackals – an excellent stop-off either on the ascent or descent.\nHiking Trail\nOnce the camel and elephant rides have been checked off the list, horse riding inevitably comes next. Horse riding in Udaipur through the city is a thoroughly adventurous and exhilarating experience; galloping through the mountains, sand dunes and the streets is enough to give you the feel of a messenger on their way to another kingdom. Princess Trails, Krishna Ranch and Pratap Country Inn are the only organizations within the city that offer horse riding, and are well worth a go.\nRitu is fascinated by the passionate relationship between life and design,which affects everything she sees, touches or marvels at.

This sprawling campus in the middle of the city is just as well known for its intriguing history and heritage as it is for its lush greenery. It is home to several temples from oriental religions and is a premier institute for the study of spirituality. Located right along the Adyar Estuary, the presence of the Theosophical Society has largely been credited for making sure this fragile ecosystem has not been disturbed by development. Among the things to do in the Theosophical Society are visiting the Adyar Big Banyan Tree, a 450-plus-year-old specimen that is among the largest in the country and the Adyar Library and Research Centre, one of the world’s most important repositories of oriental spiritual literature. \n \n \n This \n is among the \n and boasts of some of the best views of the Adyar River and the Bay of Bengal.

It is used by youngsters and couples largely as a hangout spot and is a popular sunset point in the city. This age-old structure is often associated with horror stories and urban legends, and while it is perfectly safe to visit during daytime and evening, it is also notorious for being a den of anti-social elements post dark. \n \n \n The Adyar Creek is counted among the few most fragile estuary ecosystems in the country and has remained largely untouched through the history of Chennai. However, in a measure to protect this ecosystem for the future, the Tamil Nadu Government named the estuary a protected area and started work on a mega eco-park surrounding it. And thus, in 2011, the government established what is now known as the Adyar Eco Park, or Tholkappiar Poonga. The park sprawls over an area of more than 358 acres and boasts of a vibrant fauna that includes over 10 species of mammals, 25 species of reptiles and amphibians, 90 species of birds and 30 species of fishes. Visits to the park are currently restricted to only certain areas, but the government has plans to beautify the entirety of the park confines. \n Being one of Chennai’s coolest neighbourhoods, Adyar boasts of a number of great food options, ranging from street food to fine-dining. Among the \n in the area are That Madras Place, which is known for European and Italian cuisine specialities, Cleo’s Grill and Cafe for grills and BBQs, and Adyar Ananda Bhavan for quintessential south Indian dining.

Chief among these is the original Adyar Bakery in Gandhinagar, which is now a chain of more than 35 branches and is best-known for its unique tea-bar cake. Other great dessert options include Waffles Thru The Day, Cream Stone, and the Old Madras Baking Company. \n While Adyar itself doesn’t boast of a great many \n options, it is surrounded by neighbourhoods such as Alwarpet, RA Puram, and MRC Nagar, which have some of the best-known pubs and bars in Chennai. The Velveteen Rabbit and Secret Society Bar in RA Puram are particularly popular among the city’s high-end crowd, while the Library Blu at Leela Palace and the Radio Room make for great dining-drinks options. \n \n \nThe Most Beautiful Towns In Maharashtra, India\nThe Coolest Neighbourhoods to Visit in Chennai, India\nThe Best Things To Do And See In New Delhi's Khan Market\nThe 10 Best Things To See & Do In Bhopal\nThe Best Seaside Towns to Visit in India\nThe Best Things to See and Do on East Coast Road, Chennai\nThe 10 Best Places to Visit in North India\nThe Top Things To See And Do In Indore, India\nThe Coolest Neighbourhoods to Visit in Goa, India\nThe Top 19 Things To Do And See In Bangalore North, Bangalore\nThe Top 7 Things To Do And See In South Bangalore\nThe Best Things to Do in Chennai's Adyar Neighbourhood\nWinter Sale \nSave up to $1,150 on our trips!
